# Installation

The provided code can be used with any python notebook, Anaconda is recommended to create the necessary python environments:

1. Three .yml files are included for the computervision tasks for the AFM images, processing-parameter-based machine learning, and convolutional neural network. These yml files can be imported into Anaconda to create the python environments needed to run the code.

2. The raw data is also included in each subfolder, this should allow the user to test that the code is working as intended on data with established results.
